# Machine-Learning-Lab-8-
The sphere of Supervised Learning, with Neural Networks or 'Deep Learning' being what everyone thinks of when machine learning is bought up. Again, most of the heavy lifting can now be done by libraries such as TensorFlow (other deep learning libraries are available), but in order for you to be an effective user of machine learning I think it's important for you to understand how these models actually function 'under the hood'. All of the aspects of model selection we've learnt about for our traditional models still hold true, but Neural Networks bring with them many additional aspects that need to be tuned and considered to obtain robust and effective machine learning solutions.
